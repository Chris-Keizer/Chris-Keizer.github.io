				<h2>Android App</h2>
				<br>
				<u><b>Scenario:</b></u>
				<p>A school has hired me to design a user-friendly quiz app so students will be able to take a quiz
					on their phone instead of needing a computer. With school being more online than in class, some 
					students don't have access to computers, so they want an alternative. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>Here are some visual examples:</b></p>

				<img class="app2" src="images/QuizApp2.png"/>

				<br>
				<p><b>Reflection:</b></p> 
				<p>During this assignment I had to be creative in my design and how the app functioned which is one
					of the reasons I enjoyed the android app class. Working around the restrictions that were given
					to us and designing a well laid out and appealing looking app is the best case scenario for my skill set.
				</p> 
				<br>
				<p>With the restrictions of making sure that the answers were randomized for each question and each question
					was only displayed once. We were given the question and answers in a file. I loaded the file into what's called
					a hash map. (Key, Value) Assigned the answers and questions into their own lists and any time I picked a question
					I would get the correct answer from the hash map. When it came time to assigning the answers to the buttons I 
					randomized which button would contain the right answer so that it wouldn't appear in the same place every time. 
					For the other 3 choices I'd shuffle the answer list and pick 3 different answers to go along with the correct one.
					When the question was answered I just removed it from the list.
					Once the list had no more answers left, the quiz was over.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>When looking back at what I've learned from the assignment and what I know now, I could easily enhance this app
					to be more dynamic. By hooking up a database to the app I would be able to conduct any number of quizzes without
					much extra work.
				</p>
				<p>By doing this I wouldn't be limiting the app to only using just a text file and could extend the app's usefulness.
					I would add a dynamic list that would populate from the database so the user could pick from any number of quizzes
					that were available. Instead of updating the app to add a new quiz, all you would have to do is update the database.
				</p>	
				<br>
				<p>When it comes to my work, I am always looking on how I can improve.</p>
