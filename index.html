				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My name is Chris Keizer and I am a graduated animation 
				professional with over five years of animation experience.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Over the years, I have worked in various animation roles involving different technical 
				requirements which gave me confidence in my abilities. 
				I am looking to settle into a long-term role with ongoing projects, 
				experiences and room for professional growth.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I am resilient, hard working and have worked in various animation fields 
				to gain different types of animation experience. 
				These contract experiences include working with DHX Media, 
				Orpheus Interactive and the Department of National Defense. 
				Each of these provided their own unique learning experiences.</p>
				<br>
				<p>At DHX Media, I worked as a 3D animator for multiple popular television shows 
				including Inspector Gadget, Little People, Doozers and Colorforms. 
				This position involves daily use of Maya 2016 and has made me proficient in it. 
				To ensure realism in my animation, I often use mirrors in order to act out the 
				scene to maintain accuracy and quality. This role includes both independent and 
				team collaboration for deadlines. I consistently meet my required deadlines and 
				often help other teams with their high workloads.</p>
				<br>
				<p>While working at Orpheus, I would use motion capture software to create 
				realistic animations for video games such as the episodic 
				Sons of Anarchy Season 2 mobile game. I took part in daily meetings where each 
				team member would communicate their progress and discuss animation ideas.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The Department of National Defense required animation and modeling to be 
				done for training simulations, including parachuting and machinery guides. 
				This position required extreme precision and quality assurance. 
				The primary software used for this position was 3DS Max. 
				This was a unique opportunity that involved high responsibility, 
				accountability and an opportunity to learn new techniques.Praesent
